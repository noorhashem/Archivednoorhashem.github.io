## Logistic Regression as a Nerual Network

Logistic regression is an algorithim for binary classification.
A binary classification problem that a neural network could solve is a cat calssifier that tells from an image wether there is a cat present or not, to handle images for binary classification, it should be converted into feature vectors.

i.e) an image of 64px is converted into a feature vector of 64X64X3 size = 12288 (n), since its RGB values are going to be matrices of 64X64 size.
