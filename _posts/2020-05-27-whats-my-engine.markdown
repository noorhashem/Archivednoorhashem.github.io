# Core Values

As part of participating in Outreachy, which is a program for open source contribution that I'm taking part of this summer, We were asked a question regarding our core values.

I know that I have some inner compass that guide me while taking my life decesions, but I never put much thought into defining it, I know it exists and it just does the job whenever I need it.

So, faced by this question, I had to think about the values that matter to me in life or career and explain why. I remembered that during my time in Munich at Digital Product School we had a workshop for core values, at first when I saw it on my schedule I thought : "pfft!, this is just another team building activity". but then after the workshop has ended I realized it is good to actually define them for myself so they act as a reminder for  during my journey and push me forward in the direction I desire, and most importantly, to be able to work in harmony with other team members with their values and balance my values with theirs and vice versa.

Before speaking about my 4 core values, I will share what we did in the exercise, because it wasn't just about defining our values but also how these values are balanced when we work within a team.

In this photo, an example core value was **Quietness**. When you think about a value,
first :
think about this value exaggerated negatively and what this might entail. for quietness, the negative exaggertation of quietness might be getting lonely, isolated or detached.

second :
think of a negative exaggeration of the counter value to this value, which in our case might be loudness, hysteria, inability to stop talking.

third :
take this negative counter value and think of the positive impact it might entail (positivie counter value), which is being communicative or sociable or building connections with others and gaining experience.

at the end you should find some kind of a balance utilizing your values in a team and balancing them out with a positive counter value from your other team members and that's how values can co-exist efficiently within a team and how you decide if this team will work out perfectly or not. by asking each team member to define their core values and trying to act together to maintain these values.


I remember in DPS workshop, I picked 'PURPOSE' this felt like my value back then. after picking it, we had to write down what does this value mean to us so we can define it and also we had to write down when do we feel it's fullfilled or met and share this with our teams.

we discussed the reverse value square as well, where we speculated our negative traits or behaviours and how we can make use of it for better communication and integration with others.

 in this photo for example, you start from the bottom right with an example of someone who stays late in the office and consequently gets late to appointments with his wife, this trait seems to be of an unreliable person (negative) , however, in some occasions this can be helpful because the person with this trait tends to be flexible with their time schedules, they work around it and try to tailor it to their current circumstances, even though it might not benefit them in most cases to play around too much with their schedule. on the other hand, this person's wife might to them a restricted, inconsiderate person since she doesn't adapt to the circumstances of her husband's schedule, however, she is structurednd reliable which is a trait that balances her husband's flexibility in order for it not to turn into a chaos. also, her husband balances her structured lifestyle with some flexbility, so it doesn't turn out way 'too' structured and restrictive for her. and that's when a balance happens out of negative traits as well.

as we understand the dynamics of core values, I tried to think about my values which act as the engine to my current self. and I guess I found out 4 of them.


## 1. Growth
## 2. Self-reliance
## 3. Openness
## 4. Curiosity
